## Reply Flow Spec

This specification documents only the reply flow that begins when a valid user query is dispatched to the reply engine and ends when the assistant's response is produced (console and optionally TTS) and recent dialogue memory is updated.

### Architecture Overview
- Components:
  - Reply Engine (`src/jarvis/reply/engine.py`): Orchestrates request classification, profile selection, conversation-memory enrichment, approval checking, tool-use protocol, messages loop, task state tracking, output, and memory update.
  - Profiles (`src/jarvis/profile/profiles.py`): Provide persona-specific `system_prompt` and a per-profile tool allowlist via `PROFILE_ALLOWED_TOOLS`.
  - LLM Gateway (`src/jarvis/llm.py`): `chat_with_messages` sends the messages array and returns raw JSON; `extract_text_from_response` normalizes content across providers.
  - Conversation Memory (`src/jarvis/memory/conversation.py`): Supplies recent dialogue messages and keyword/time-bounded recall.
  - Enrichment LLM (`src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py`): Extracts search params (keywords and optional time bounds) from the current query to drive conversation recall.
  - Task State (`src/jarvis/task_state.py`): Session-scoped tracker for the active task – intent, execution steps, status, and resumption support.
  - Approval (`src/jarvis/approval.py`): Risk assessment and approval logic; classifies requests as informational/operational and tool invocations as safe/moderate/high risk.

Design principles enforced by the engine:
- Tool-Profile Separation: Tools define data retrieval; profiles define style/instructions.
- Tool Response Flow: Tools return raw data; formatting/personality is handled by the LLM through the engine's loop. The system prompt explicitly instructs the model to use tool results to fulfill the user's original request, not to describe the structure or format of the tool response.
- Language-Agnostic Design: Prompts and ASR guidance avoid language-specific phrasing.
- Data Privacy: Inputs are redacted and logging is concise and purposeful via `debug_log`.
- Autonomy with Safety: The engine acts automatically on clear instructions, asks clarification only when genuinely ambiguous, and requires explicit approval for destructive or high-impact operations.

### Entry and Inputs
- Entry point: the reply engine receives a user query from the ingestion layer.
- Inputs:
  - text (string): a redaction-eligible user query.
  - persistent store: a database-like service, optionally with vector search.
  - configuration: model endpoints, timeouts, feature flags, and tool settings.
  - speech synthesizer (optional): for spoken output and hot-window activation.

### Steps and Branches (Agentic Messages Loop)
1. Redact
   - Redact input to remove sensitive data.

1a. Classify & Begin Task
   - Classify the request as `informational` or `operational` using `classify_request()` from `src/jarvis/approval.py`.
   - Call `begin_task(intent)` from `src/jarvis/task_state.py` to initialise session-scoped state tracking.

2. Profile Selection
   - Use a lightweight LLM-based router to select the profile; load its system guidance.

3. Recent Dialogue Context
   - Include short-term dialogue memory (last 5 minutes) as prior messages.

4. Conversation Memory Enrichment (optional)
   - Extract search parameters via `extract_search_params_for_memory(query, base_url, chat_model, ...)`.
     - Output fields: `keywords: List[str]`, optional `from`, optional `to`.
   - If `keywords` present, call `search_conversation_memory_by_keywords(db, keywords, from_time, to_time, ...)` to retrieve relevant snippets (bounded by configured max results).
   - Join snippets into a `conversation_context` string for inclusion in the system message.

5. Build Initial Messages
   - messages = [
     {role: system, content: general instructions + profile-specific instructions + ASR note + tool protocol + enrichment },
     ...recent dialogue messages...,
     {role: user, content: redacted user text}
   ]

   System message composition:
   - Start with the profile `system_prompt`.
   - Append ASR note: inputs come from speech transcription and may include errors; prefer user intent and ask brief clarifying questions when uncertain.
   - Append the tool-use protocol (allowed response formats and MCP invocation format if configured).
   - Append `Relevant conversation history:` when enrichment produced context.
   - Append `Tools:` with the dynamically generated tool descriptions (including configured MCP servers, if any) and guidance for preferring real data over shell commands.

6. Agentic Messages Loop with Dynamic Context
   - For each turn of the loop (max `agentic_max_turns` turns, default 8):
     - Update first system message with fresh time/location context
     - Send messages to LLM with native tool calling via Ollama's tools API parameter
     - Parse response using standard OpenAI-compatible message format:
       - `tool_calls` field: Execute tools and continue loop
       - `thinking` field: Internal reasoning (not shown to user), continue loop
       - `content` field: Natural language response to user
   - Note: System messages are NOT added after the conversation starts, as this breaks native tool calling in models like Llama 3.2

7. Tool and Planning Protocol
   - The LLM responds using standard OpenAI-compatible message format:
     - **Tool calls**: Use `tool_calls` field to request data or actions
     - **Internal reasoning**: Use `thinking` field for step-by-step reasoning (not shown to user)
     - **Final responses**: Use `content` field for natural language answers
     - **Clarifying questions**: Use `content` field when user intent is unclear
   - Each response is appended to messages (preserving `thinking` and `tool_calls` fields) and the loop continues until:
     - LLM provides natural language content
     - Maximum turn limit (8) is reached
     - LLM returns empty response with no tool calls for multiple turns

   Tool protocol details:
   - Native tool calling: Tools are passed to Ollama via the `tools` API parameter in OpenAI-compatible JSON schema format
   - The LLM requests tools via the standard `tool_calls` field in its response message
   - Internal reasoning uses the `thinking` field (not shown to user)
   - Allowed tools: profile allowlist plus MCP (if configured)
   - Duplicate suppression: the engine returns a tool error response for repeated calls with identical args, guiding the model to use prior results
   - Tool results are appended to messages as `{role: "tool", tool_call_id: "<id>", content: "<text>"}`; errors as `{role: "tool", tool_call_id: "<id>", content: "Error: <message>"}`
   - No system message injection: The engine does NOT add system messages during the loop as this breaks native tool calling; instead, guidance is provided via tool error responses when needed

   **Approval Gate (Decision Policy):**
   - Before each tool execution, `requires_approval(tool_name, tool_args)` is called.
   - HIGH-risk operations (e.g., `localFiles` with `operation=delete`, `deleteMeal`) require explicit user confirmation.
   - When approval is required, the engine returns an approval prompt to the user and halts execution; the user must re-issue the command with confirmation.
   - SAFE and MODERATE operations proceed automatically without interruption.
   - Risk levels per tool are defined in `src/jarvis/approval.py`.

   **Task Step Tracking:**
   - Each tool execution is recorded as a `TaskStep` on the active `TaskState`.
   - Steps track: description, tool name, status (PENDING→RUNNING→SUCCEEDED/FAILED), result summary, and timing.
   - The `TaskState` transitions: IDLE → PLANNING → EXECUTING → AWAITING_APPROVAL | DONE | FAILED.

8. Output and Memory Update
   - Remove any tool protocol markers (e.g., lines beginning with a reserved prefix) from the final response.
   - Print reply with a concise header; optionally include debug labeling.
   - If speech synthesis is enabled, speak the reply and, upon completion, trigger the follow-up listening window if configured.
   - Mark the active `TaskState` as DONE (or FAILED on error).
   - Add the interaction (sanitized user/assistant texts) to short-term dialogue memory; ignore failures.

### Notes
- This document intentionally excludes ingestion specifics (voice/stdin, wake/hot-window, stop/echo), tool internals, and diary update scheduling. Those are documented separately.

#### ASR Note
- All user inputs are assumed to originate from speech transcription and may include errors, omissions, or punctuation issues. The system prompt instructs the model to prioritize user intent over literal wording and to ask a brief clarifying question when meaning is uncertain. This guidance is language-agnostic.

#### Dynamic Context Injection
The system injects fresh contextual information before each LLM call in the agentic loop to ensure the model has current, relevant information:

**Context Format:**
```
[Context: Monday, September 15, 2025 at 17:53 UTC, Location: San Francisco, CA, United States (America/Los_Angeles)]

{original system prompt content}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Context is prepended to the FIRST system message before every turn of the 8-turn agentic loop
- Note: Separate context messages are NOT used because adding system messages after the conversation starts breaks native tool calling in models like Llama 3.2
- Time is provided in UTC format with day name for clarity
- Location is derived from configured IP address or auto-detection (if enabled)
- Falls back gracefully to "Location: Unknown" if location services unavailable
- Context gathering failures don't interrupt the conversation flow

**Benefits:**
- Time-aware scheduling and deadline suggestions
- Location-relevant recommendations and services
- Fresh context updates throughout multi-turn conversations
- No accumulation of stale temporal information

#### Agentic Flow Examples

**Simple Single-Tool Flow:**
```
User: "What's the weather in London?"
Turn 1: LLM → {content: "", tool_calls: [{function: {name: "webSearch", arguments: {query: "London weather today"}}}]}
Turn 2: LLM → {content: "It's 18°C and sunny in London today with light winds."}
```

**Multi-Step Planning Flow:**
```
User: "Book sushi for two tonight at seven"
Turn 1: LLM → {content: "", thinking: "I need to check restaurant availability first", tool_calls: [{function: {name: "checkAvailability", arguments: {cuisine: "sushi", time: "19:00", party: 2}}}]}
Turn 2: LLM → {content: "7:00 is fully booked. Would you prefer 6:30 PM or 8:15 PM?", thinking: "7:00 is unavailable, I should offer alternatives"}
```

**Iterative Research Flow:**
```
User: "Compare the latest iPhone models"
Turn 1: LLM → {content: "", tool_calls: [{function: {name: "webSearch", arguments: {query: "iPhone 15 models comparison 2024"}}}]}
Turn 2: LLM → {content: "", thinking: "I have basic specs but need pricing information", tool_calls: [{function: {name: "webSearch", arguments: {query: "iPhone 15 Pro Max price official"}}}]}
Turn 3: LLM → {content: "", thinking: "I should also get user reviews for a complete comparison", tool_calls: [{function: {name: "webSearch", arguments: {query: "iPhone 15 Pro vs Pro Max reviews"}}}]}
Turn 4: LLM → {content: "Here's a comprehensive comparison of the iPhone 15 models: [detailed response]"}
```

### Configuration and Defaults
- Timeouts (seconds):
  - `llm_profile_select_timeout_sec` (profile routing)
  - `llm_tools_timeout_sec` (enrichment extraction)
  - `llm_embed_timeout_sec` (vector search)
  - `llm_chat_timeout_sec` (messages loop turn)
- Memory enrichment:
  - `memory_enrichment_max_results` limits recalled snippets.
- Tools and MCP:
  - `PROFILE_ALLOWED_TOOLS` governs default allowlist per profile; MCP servers added from `cfg.mcps`.
- Agentic loop:
  - `agentic_max_turns` maximum turns in the agentic loop (default 8)
- Context injection:
  - `location_enabled` enables/disables location services
  - `location_ip_address` manual IP configuration for geolocation
  - `location_auto_detect` enables automatic IP detection (privacy consideration)
- Output and debugging:
  - `voice_debug` toggles verbose stderr debug vs emoji console output.

### Model-Size-Aware Prompts

The reply engine automatically detects model size and adjusts prompts accordingly. This is critical because small models (1b, 3b, 7b) lack the reasoning capacity to infer when NOT to use tools from implicit guidance.

**Detection:**
```python
from jarvis.reply.prompts import detect_model_size, get_system_prompts

model_size = detect_model_size(cfg.ollama_chat_model)  # SMALL or LARGE
prompts = get_system_prompts(model_size)
```

**Prompt Differences:**

| Component | Large Model (8b+) | Small Model (1b-7b) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `tool_incentives` | "Proactively use available tools..." | "Use tools ONLY when explicitly required..." |
| `tool_guidance` | "Use them proactively..." | Brief guidance without proactive language |
| `tool_constraints` | Not included | Explicit list of when NOT to use tools |

**Small Model Constraints:**
Small models receive an explicit list of scenarios where tools should NOT be used:
- Greetings in any language (hello, ni hao, bonjour, etc.)
- Small talk, thank you, goodbye
- Questions answerable from general knowledge
- Casual conversation

This prevents issues like calling `webSearch` for "ni hao" (Chinese greeting).

See `src/jarvis/reply/prompts/prompts.spec.md` for full prompt architecture documentation.

### Logging and Privacy
- Use `debug_log` for key steps: `profile`, `memory`, `planning`, and `voice` categories.
- Avoid excessive logging; logs must remain readable and privacy-preserving.
